# Clojure programming with VSpaceCode

VSpaceCode is an extension to VSCode that provides a complete keyboard driven experience, driving not just the text but the whole editor.

A mnemonic menu system on top of the VSCode command pallet is driven by which-key and provides access to a far wider range of commands that VSCode alone.

Practicalli added VSpaceCode key bindings for Calva to provide an effective Clojure workflow.
